                        Gonder was the capital of Ethiopia from 1632 to 1855, and it 
                        has the remains of castles and palaces constructed by a series 
                        of emperors from Fasilides (reigned 1632–67) to Iyasu II (1730–55).
                        The ruins of these structures stand within a walled imperial enclosure.

                        In the 16th and 17th centuries, the fortress-city of Fasil Ghebbi 
                        was the residence of the Ethiopian emperor Fasilides and his successors. 
                        Surrounded by a 900-m-long wall, the city contains palaces, churches, monasteries
                        and unique public and private buildings marked by Hindu and Arab influences, 
                        subsequently transformed by the Baroque style brought to Gondar by the Jesuit
                        missionaries

                        Between the thirteenth and seventeenth centuries, Ethiopian rulers
                         moved their royal camps frequently. King Fasil (Fasilidas) settled 
                         in Gondar and established it as a permanent capital in 1636. Before 
                         its decline in the late eighteenth century, the royal court had developed 
                         from a camp into a fortified compound called Fasil Ghebbi, consisting of 
                         six major building complexes and other ancillary buildings, surrounded by 
                         a wall 900 metres long, with twelve entrances and three bridges.

                        Fasil Ghebbi and the other remains in Gondar city demonstrate a remarkable 
                        interface between internal and external cultures, with cultural elements 
                        related to Ethiopian Orthodox Church,Ethiopian Jews and Muslims. This relationship 
                        is expressed not only through the architecture of the sites but also through the handicrafts, painting, 
                        literature and music that flourished in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.
