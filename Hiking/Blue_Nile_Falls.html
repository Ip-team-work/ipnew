                                  <p>The Simien Mountains in Northern Ethiopia offer some of the finest highland trekking in the world with rare wildlife, vast views and fascinating traditional villages all on view. The Simien Mountains National Park is a UNESCO World Heritage site and treks follow a common trail from park campsites along a dramatic ridge that overlooks mile upon mile of hill country.
                                    <br>
                                  This extended 8 day trek includes many of the highlights of the classic 5 day trek, including the 700m drop at Genbar Falls, the 360 degree views at Imiet Gogo and of course plenty of opportunity to catch a glimpse of the native Gelada Baboons and majestic Whallia Ibex. What marks this trek out are the last 3 days heading down into the lowlands away from the crowds. Expect refreshing swims in rivers, rich bird-life and buzzing villages.</p>

                                        4-5hrs driving, 7km 2/3 hours walking
                                        You’ll be picked up from your hotel in Gonder around 7.30am for the 2 ½ hr drive to Debark. The road is rough and very dusty, but if you haven’t left the built up areas in Ethiopia yet, it is a real eye opener into the life of the rural majority.
                                        <br> <br>

                                       <b>DAY 2: </b> Sankaber (3,200m) – Geech Camp (3,600m)
                                        Walking 7-8hrs / 15km
                                        After a hearty breakfast, you’ll set off trekking along the ridge with stunning views over the foothills 800m below. For the first two hours the trail passes through low bush of Giant Heather, soda apple, Abyssinian rose, St John’s Wort and Globe thistle. 
                                        <br><br>

                                       <b>DAY 3:</b>  Geech (3,600m) – Imet Gogo (3,926m) – Siha Gorge – Kedar Dit – Geech (3,600m)

                                        After breakfast you’ll trek for 2 hours along the grass plateau past countless bizarre outsized Giant Lobelia plants. The destination is Imet Gogo, an incredible rocky promontory that grants 360 degree views over the Simien Range. At an altitude of 3,926m you can see West back along the ridge towards Sankaber and Geech and South East across a deep gully towards the tomorrow’s ridge walk to Inatye and Cheneck Camp.

                                        <br> <br>

                                        <b>DAY 5: </b>Chennek (3600m) – Sonar (3500m)

After lunch there is a further 2 hour walk along the banks of the river to Mekarbra where you camp in the village. 5-6 hours walking

                                        The walk today passes along the dry river bed of the Incya River.
